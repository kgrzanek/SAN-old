* Assignment 0
  Install JDK in your computer (at home/school).
* Assignment 1
  Provide an implementation of factorial function. Study the correctness of the
  arguments in a way similar to what we did during the class/lab.
  factorial(n) =
    1                  for n = 0
    n * factorial(n-1) for n > 0
* Assignment 2
  - Euler 2
  - Euler 4
  - Euler 9
* Assignment 3
  - Implement -, *, / for Complex class
  - Implement conjugate operator for Complex class
* Assignment 4
  Use the new Complex interface (+ 2 classes implementing the interface) to provide:
  - -, *, /
  - conjugate
  Use polar and planar representations where needed
* Assignment 5
  Design and implement a class to represent vectors in 3D space. There should be
  methods to represent vector addition, subtraction, scalar product.
* Assignment 6
  Design and implement a set of classes to represent various kinds of vehicles:
  cars, motorbikes, mics. car types: SUV, compact, etc. Implement methods of
  your own choice.
